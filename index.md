## Project Description
The goal of Ihiyo is to create an immersive, narrative-driven puzzle game where players explore a rundown, rural town, form connections with its inhabitants, both living and dead, and solve puzzles using the protagonist’s newfound ability to project a ghost form. The core gameplay allows players to possess and manipulate people and objects to offer a unique and atmospheric experience which blends storytelling, gameplay, and world-building. Players will uncover the mystery of the protagonist’s curse and the impending end of the world by progressing through the thrilling story. Ihiyo emphasizes its transitions between the protagonist’s physical form and his ghostly projection, encouraging use of both forms to interact with key people or objects. Each puzzle aims to contribute to the overarching narrative, ensuring that the gameplay and story work together to create a cohesive, engaging experience.
The primary audience for Ihiyo includes players who enjoy story-driven games and complex puzzle-solving. It is aimed at those who value rich narratives and detailed puzzles, particularly players seeking a thought-provoking experience that encourages personal reflection through the employed themes. As a development towards the unexplored genre of story-integrated puzzle games, this project is beneficial because it gives players an experience that they cannot find in other games. Furthermore, it is in the public’s interest as it is a pioneering project that aims to attract new players to the gaming world. 
Looking into the main functionalities and mechanics within Ihiyo, The puzzles and story are designed to create a meaningful connection with the protagonist's journey and provoke deep introspection in the player. The ability to transition between physical and ghostly forms provides a fresh, dynamic gameplay mechanic, encouraging creative approaches to puzzles and interactions with NPCs. Each puzzle challenges the player’s critical thinking while advancing the story, ensuring gameplay and narrative remain intertwined. 
To bring Ihiyo to life, Unity is used as the development platform for its versatility in creating immersive environments, complex puzzles, and seamless form transitions. C# is the cornerstone for scripting gameplay mechanics, puzzle interactions, and narrative systems. Graphics resources, including tilesets and character sprites, were purchased from GameDevMarket for affordability and convenience. The game will be supported on PC (Windows/Mac) through the indie platform itch.io. Ihiyo is designed to run efficiently on low-spec hardware, with minimal CPU, GPU, and RAM requirements, ensuring smooth performance on older or budget-friendly devices.
Ihiyo is designed with dependability in mind, focusing on all aspects to deliver an unforgettable experience. Reliability will be ensured through extensive testing of game mechanics, puzzles, and transitions between physical and ghost forms to eliminate bugs and crashes, ensuring smooth and immersive gameplay. Since the game is entirely single-player and does not involve storing player information, security concerns are minimal, allowing more focus on gameplay optimization. Safety will be prioritized by providing an accessible and inclusive environment with features such as content warnings, and in-game guidance settings to enhance player comfort and enjoyment. These dependability properties will be achieved through thorough quality assurance and ongoing attention to feedback.
