# Welcome to Ihiyo

This is the homepage for our CS 426 Senior Project at UNR, CSE Department.

## Project Description
Ihiyo is an isometric role-playing 3D puzzle game with a primary focus of delivering an overarching and compelling narrative about overcoming a generational curse. The nine year old protagonist, Ihiyo Nali, finds himself in an unfamiliar rundown town that is drowning under an overbearing sense of dread. After a shocking fateful night, Ihiyo finds himself cursed as his body is able to shift into a ghost, thus granting him access to the undead. With this newfound power, Ihiyo must explore the town by possessing and manipulating various different people and objects to solve puzzles and uncover the mystery behind his accursed body, otherwise he may never find the answer.
